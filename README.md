# CustomRedirectQuickActionCmp

## Description
Quick actions are great but there is one small caveat. You cannot do prevalidation when redirecting to a standard quick action. This component allows you to easily create a quick action that redirects to a standard record create or edit page for a sObject and provides an interface to populate default values and show an error based on validation logic in the parent component.
